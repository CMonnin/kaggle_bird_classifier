# kaggle_bird_classifier

## Description

This project is related to the Kaggle competition [100-bird-species](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species). The objective of the competition is to build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for accurately classifying 15 selected bird species. In this project, we leverage [transfer learning](https://keras.io/guides/transfer_learning/), specifically using the [MobileNetV2](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/) model as the base model, to construct the CNN.

The CNN achieved an average accuracy of 95% on the test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning in image classification. Additionally, the model achieved a perfect accuracy of 100% on a small validation set. This project serves as a showcase of how transfer learning can enhance the performance of a CNN in the task of bird species classification.
